# CodeAlpha_Credit_Scoring_Model
**Task 1:**
Develop a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and assess the model's accuracy.

**Introduction:**
Credit scoring is a crucial financial tool used by lenders to evaluate the risk associated with lending money to individuals. The primary goal is to determine the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan. This project focuses on developing a predictive model using historical financial data to assess an individual's creditworthiness.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to build a robust and accurate classification model that can predict whether an individual is creditworthy based on various financial and personal attributes. The model will assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions, thereby reducing the risk of default and improving profitability.

**Methodology:**
The development of a credit scoring model involved several key steps to ensure accuracy and reliability. Initially, historical financial data were collected, encompassing features such as credit history, income, loan amounts, employment status, and other pertinent financial indicators. The data underwent rigorous preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies. Feature engineering was employed to create new variables like the debt-to-income ratio, and normalization was applied to standardize the data. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, typically in an 80-20 ratio. Various classification algorithms were selected for model development, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. Each model was trained on the training set, and hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) were used to assess model performance on the testing set. Cross-validation was also conducted to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.

**Outcomes:**
The model evaluation process revealed that among the tested algorithms, the Random Forest classifier exhibited the highest performance, with an accuracy of 85% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.92. These metrics indicate a strong ability to differentiate between creditworthy and non-creditworthy individuals.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the development and evaluation of the credit scoring model demonstrated its potential as a valuable tool for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. The Random Forest classifier, with its superior accuracy and predictive power, was identified as the best-performing model. The importance of key features such as credit history, income, and debt-to-income ratio provides actionable insights for lenders.
